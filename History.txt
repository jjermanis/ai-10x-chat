The goal is a guess a number between 1 and 10^x. That exponent increases each time you guess 
a number. You start with a number between 1 and 10, then 1 and 100, 1 and 1000, and so on.
This was the first game I developed way-back-when. Estimate: 1981. This will, eventually, 
have many visual and audio implements. No specific reason - just making a basic game appear
exciting.
For each guess, the low number appears on the left, and the high number appears on the right.
The player guesses. If they get it correct, they let the player know, and the next level starts.
If the number is too low, it is assigned to the left end, and turns into the guess + 1.
If the number is too high, it is assigned to the right end, and turns into the guess - 1.
For each level, the players gets the minimum number of guesses that will always allow the
number to be guessed, if they play correctly.
The initial version of the game was implemented by Chat. It worked well. There was one
easy to resolve the mistakes. Initially, after a guess, the number was sent to the wrong
end. Easy to determine and fix. Playable as-is! Lots of UI enhancements next.


Version 00.02	26 minutes dev	2 minutes code gen	3 minutes test		59 minutes total

The previous version was playable. For this version, adding in some UI elements. 
Added moving exponents to the big 10 at the top of the screen. Game starts with a plain 10
up top. After each level ends, the old exponent (if there is one there) exits to the right.
The new exponent, the next number, enters from the right. There was an initial defect: the 
old exponent would disappear mid-exit. This was pointed out to Chat - it was quickly fixed.
For the time being, moved the guess control to below the main game screen. This was needed
for another change in this version. This was easy: worked the first time.
The center of the game screen is now used for the guess. If the guess is correct, it turns
gold and sits there for 1 second. If it is wrong, the guess moves from the center, left or
right depending on the guess. It collides with the number, and adjusts based on the updated
limits. This had a small bug: the previous and new values were both shown. Let Chat know -
it resolved the issue easy. There is a remaining tweak: when the number moves, it doesn't
always start in the center. Where it ended the last move, that will be where it starts.
That one I'll add to my TODO list.


Version 00.03	14 minutes dev	3 minute code gen	4 minutes test		1 hour 20

This version is to add some UI details to make the game cleaner to play. As the guess is
typed in the text box, the number will be shown in the center of the game screen as the
number is typed. This allows a more consistent focus on the game screen, and better UI to
focus on. Also, I added comma-based digital separation (e.g 1,468,315) for numbers. This
makes the game much easier to read, especially as those numbers get bigger. Finally, 
there was a defect I mentioned from the last version: "when the number moves, it doesn't
always start in the center. Where it ended the last move, that will be where it starts."
These were implemented fairly quickly. The previous defect about where the numbers to
continue to move around was still there. I pointed out the defect to Chat: I showed the
line in the description being ignored and I point out what was happening. I tried to fix 
it - it worked, but had a side effect on the colors. After completing the level, the
numbers in the center turn gold. However, it was still showing as a gold for the first
guess. Chat provided the expected one-liner to address it.
This took a few iterations to implement, but on the upside, it fixed several known 
defects.
App is playable as-is after a very modest amount of time. Will look for a few enhancements.
Release #1 might be quite quick.


Version 00.04 	10 minutes dev	1 minute code gen	3 minutes test		1 hour 34

There are a couple minor enhancements made here.
First, when the correct answer is guessed, the old exponent immediately exited, replaced
by the new one. To help the UI a bit, when they are announced as correct, the game will
wait for 2 seconds. The first attempt by Chat worked well, but with an edge case. If
you type numbers during those 2 seconds, the golden UI is updated. You can change it to 
the wrong number and it will update the (still) gold number. To fix, the text entry will  
be disabled during the gold color exponent travel sequence. That worked well.
Next, the guess text entry and Guess button have slightly different vertical sizes and 
locations. I wanted both to match the height and Y-axis location of the text entry. Chat
generated this code quickly, and the first iteration worked.


Version 00.05	9 minutes dev	1 minute code gen	3 minutes test		1 hour 47

Fixed a small bug. When someone enters an invalid number, the UI shows "Invalid Guess". 
When it is shown, it moves the guess entry text and button. I didn't want other UI to move.
To prevent that, and keep UI space minimal, I asked Chat to move that text to the center,'
below the guess. It did this - no issues.
Made a small layout change. On my laptop screen, the game doesn't quite fit - the bottom
controls are cut-off a bit, even with browser on max. I dropped the height from 500 to
400 pixels. I asked ChatGPT if there were other things it thought needed changed. He
recommended the controls on the bottom of the screen changed slightly. I disagree - I 
thought the layout was fine after making that change.
There is a debug view to show the answer. To use it, it was commented in/out. I changed
this to manual code. Set an internal const DEBUG to true or false to show. This was 
trivial - no Chat needed.
There was a small grammatical error. When there was one move remaining, the UI showed: 
"You have 1 guesses remaining". That's not grammatically correct. To fix, I could go for
a simple change. Instead I'll go for the dramatic "Last remaining guess!" This string is
used in two different places. To keep in clear, I want to put it in a function - if more
changes are made for this, I want it in one spot. I can do this, but I gave it to Chat.
It was quick and easy - worked first time.


TODO: A nice optimization - to start a guess, if left and right have the same number of digits,
	include all those in a row (starting from the left) that match. Those will HAVE to 
	be in all possible guesses.
TODO: When the game is over, the user can type in guesses. You can't actually make a guess,
	but the UI allows it. Maybe disable those to make it clear.
Note: This game will be able to play up to 15 digits. This is probably fine: 10 or 12 to
	end the game, so it'll work. It's here for reference.
Note: The calculation for guaranteed moves to allow win is accurate, but can run rough.
	A moderate sub-optimal guess or two can make it possible to lose. Maybe tweak
	to add one move move? Still challenging, but a hair forgiving.
