The goal is a guess a number between 1 and 10^x. That exponent increases each time you guess 
a number. You start with a number between 1 and 10, then 1 and 100, 1 and 1000, and so on.
This was the first game I developed way-back-when. Estimate: 1981. This will, eventually, 
have many visual and audio implements. No specific reason - just making a basic game appear
exciting.
For each guess, the low number appears on the left, and the high number appears on the right.
The player guesses. If they get it correct, they let the player know, and the next level starts.
If the number is too low, it moves to the left end, and turns into the guess + 1.
If the number is too high, it moves to the right end, and turns into the guess - 1.
For each level, the players gets the minimum number of guesses that will always allow the
number to be guessed, if they play correctly.
The initial version of the game was implemented by Chat. It worked well. There was one
easy to resolve the mistakes. Initially, after a guess, the number was sent to the wrong
end. Easy to determine and fix. Playable as-is! Lots of UI enhancments next.


TODO When the player wins, show the guess in the center in gold, to let them know they won.
TOOO When the player guesses wrong, have a number in the center move to the left/right to
	update the limits.
TODO Place an exponent for the current level being played. In place, for the title 10 up top.
TODO When the player wins, have the old exponent exit right, and the new exponent enters 
	from right.
TODO Use comma separation when value get big
