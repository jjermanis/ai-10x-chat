The goal is a guess a number between 1 and 10^x. That exponent increases each time you guess 
a number. You start with a number between 1 and 10, then 1 and 100, 1 and 1000, and so on.
This was the first game I developed way-back-when. Estimate: 1981. This will, eventually, 
have many visual and audio implements. No specific reason - just making a basic game appear
exciting.
For each guess, the low number appears on the left, and the high number appears on the right.
The player guesses. If they get it correct, they let the player know, and the next level starts.
If the number is too low, it is assigned to the left end, and turns into the guess + 1.
If the number is too high, it is assigned to the right end, and turns into the guess - 1.
For each level, the players gets the minimum number of guesses that will always allow the
number to be guessed, if they play correctly.
The initial version of the game was implemented by Chat. It worked well. There was one
easy to resolve the mistakes. Initially, after a guess, the number was sent to the wrong
end. Easy to determine and fix. Playable as-is! Lots of UI enhancements next.


Version 00.02	26 minutes dev	2 minutes code gen	3 minutes test		59 minutes total

The previous version was playable. For this version, adding in some UI elements. 
Added moving exponents to the big 10 at the top of the screen. Game starts with a plain 10
up top. After each level ends, the old exponent (if there is one there) exits to the right.
The new exponent, the next number, enters from the right. There was an initial defect: the 
old exponent would disappear mid-exit. This was pointed out to Chat - it was quickly fixed.
For the time being, moved the guess control to below the main game screen. This was needed
for another change in this version. This was easy: worked the first time.
The center of the game screen is now used for the guess. If the guess is correct, it turns
gold and sits there for 1 second. If it is wrong, the guess moves from the center, left or
right depending on the guess. It collides with the number, and adjusts based on the updated
limits. This had a small bug: the previous and new values were both shown. Let Chat know -
it resolved the issue easy. There is a remaining tweak: when the number moves, it doesn't
always start in the center. Where it ended the last move, that will be where it starts.
That one I'll add to my TODO list.


Version 00.03	14 minutes dev	3 minute code gen	4 minutes test		1 hour 20

This version is to add some UI details to make the game cleaner to play. As the guess is
typed in the text box, the number will be shown in the center of the game screen as the
number is typed. This allows a more consistent focus on the game screen, and better UI to
focus on. Also, I added comma-based digital separation (e.g 1,468,315) for numbers. This
makes the game much easier to read, especially as those numbers get bigger. Finally, 
there was a defect I mentioned from the last version: "when the number moves, it doesn't
always start in the center. Where it ended the last move, that will be where it starts."
These were implemented fairly quickly. The previous defect about where the numbers to
continue to move around was still there. I pointed out the defect to Chat: I showed the
line in the description being ignored and I point out what was happening. I tried to fix 
it - it worked, but had a side effect on the colors. After completing the level, the
numbers in the center turn gold. However, it was still showing as a gold for the first
guess. Chat provided the expected one-liner to address it.
This took a few iterations to implement, but on the upside, it fixed several known 
defects.
App is playable as-is after a very modest amount of time. Will look for a few enhancements.
Release #1 might be quite quick.



TODO: Add a delay on level victory: number goes gold for a second, THEN the exponents do their moving.
TODO: The text entry and button are different sizes. I'd like then to be the same.
TODO: A nice optimization - to start a guess, if left and right have the same number of digits,
	include all those in a row (starting from the left) that match. Those will HAVE to 
	be in all guesses.
TODO: Small grammatical error. For last guess it says "You have 1 guesses remaining" Make
	singular, or maybe change like "Last remaining guess!"
Note: This game will be able to play up to 15 digits. This is probably fine: 10 or 12 I
	think are the limits. It's here for reference.
